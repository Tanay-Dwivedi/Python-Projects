# Text to Handwriting

To convert text to handwriting, there is a library known as `PyWhatKit` in Python. It provides a lot of useful features, but the feature I’m most interested in is converting the text of a user’s input to handwritten text.

-----

## Installation

```
pip install pywhatkit
```
```
pip install opencv-python
```

Firstly import the `pywhatkit` and `opencv-python` libraries through the terminal that will help in the program.

-----

## Code Break:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import pywhatkit as kit
import cv2
```

These lines import the required libraries (`pywhatkit` and `cv2`).

```python
# Prompt the user to enter text
text = input("Enter your text: ")
```

This line uses the `input()` function to prompt the user to enter text, and the entered text is stored in the variable `text`.

```python
# Use pywhatkit to convert the text to handwriting and save it as an image
kit.text_to_handwriting(text, save_to="handwritten_text.png")
```

The `kit.text_to_handwriting()` function is used to convert the entered text to handwriting and save it as an image named "handwritten_text.png."

```python
# Read the saved image using OpenCV
image = cv2.imread("handwritten_text.png")
```

The `cv2.imread()` function is used to read the saved image ("handwritten_text.png") using OpenCV, and the image data is stored in the variable `image`.

```python
# Display the image using OpenCV
cv2.imshow("Text to Handwriting", image)
```

The `cv2.imshow()` function is used to display the image in a window with the title "Text to Handwriting."

```python
# Wait for a key press and close the window when a key is pressed
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

The `cv2.waitKey(0)` waits for a key press, and `cv2.destroyAllWindows()` closes the OpenCV window when a key is pressed.

When you run this script, it will prompt you to enter text, convert it to handwriting, save it as an image, and display the handwritten text using OpenCV.
