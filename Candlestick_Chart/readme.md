# Candlestick Chart

A candlestick chart is a data visualization tool used to analyze the price movements of stocks, cryptocurrencies, currencies, and other financial instruments.

## Installation

```
pip install pandas plotly
```
Firstly import the `pandas, plotly` library through the terminal that will help in the program.

-----

## Code Break:

Certainly! Let's break down the provided code:

```python
import pandas as pd
```
This line imports the Pandas library with the alias `pd`. Pandas is a powerful data manipulation library for Python.

```python
import plotly.graph_objects as go
```
This line imports the `plotly.graph_objects` module, which is used for creating interactive and visually appealing plots.

```python
data = pd.read_csv("<your csv file>")
```
This line reads a CSV file named "<your csv file>" and loads its contents into a Pandas DataFrame called `data`.

```python
figure = go.Figure(
    data=[
        go.Candlestick(
            x=data["Date"],
            open=data["Open"],
            high=data["High"],
            low=data["Low"],
            close=data["Close"],
        )
    ]
)
```
Here, a `go.Figure` object is created with a `go.Candlestick` trace. This trace represents a candlestick chart using the OHLC (Open-High-Low-Close) data from the DataFrame. The x-axis is represented by the "Date" column, and the OHLC values are provided.

```python
figure.update_layout(
    title="Apple Stock Price Analysis", xaxis_rangeslider_visible=False
)
```
This updates the layout of the figure. It sets the title of the chart to "Apple Stock Price Analysis" and hides the x-axis range slider.

```python
figure.show()
```
Finally, this line displays the interactive candlestick chart. The `show()` function is used to render the chart.
