# Generate Password

To create a password with Python, we need to create a program that takes the length of the password and generates a random password of the same length.

-----

## Code Break:

```python
import random
```

This line imports the `random` module, which is used for generating random elements.

```python
passlen = int(input("enter the length of password: "))
```

This line prompts the user to input the desired length of the password and converts the input to an integer (`int`).

```python
s = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz01234567890ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ!@#$%^&*()?"
```

This line defines a string `s` containing lowercase letters, digits, uppercase letters, and a set of special characters.

```python
p = "".join(random.sample(s, passlen))
```

This line uses `random.sample()` to generate a sample of `passlen` characters from the string `s`. The `"".join()` method is then used to concatenate these characters into a single string, creating the random password.

```python
print(p)
```

This line prints the generated password to the console.

For example, if the user enters `12` as the desired password length, the output might be something like:

```
Y0$Hh(e5#&dZ
```

Note: The use of `random.sample()` ensures that the characters in the password are unique, and the resulting password will have the specified length.
