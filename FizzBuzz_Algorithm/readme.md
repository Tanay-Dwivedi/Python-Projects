# FizzBuzz Algorithm

Fizz and Buzz refer to any number that is a multiple of 3 and 5.

- If the integer (x) is divisible by 3, the output must be replaced by “Fizz”.
- If the integer (x) is divisible by 5, the output must be replaced by “Buzz”.
- If the integer (x) is divisible by 3 and 5, the output should be replaced by “FizzBuzz”.

# Code Break:

```python
for i in range(1, 20):
```

This line initiates a `for` loop that iterates through the numbers from 1 to 19 (inclusive). The loop variable `i` takes on each value in the specified range during each iteration.

```python
    if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
```

This line checks if the current value of `i` is divisible by both 3 and 5. If true, it means the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5 (15), and "FizzBuzz" is printed.

```python
        print("FizzBuzz")
```

If the condition in the previous line is met, "FizzBuzz" is printed.

```python
    elif i % 3 == 0:
```

This line checks if the current value of `i` is divisible by 3. If true, it means the number is a multiple of 3, and "Fizz" is printed.

```python
        print("Fizz")
```

If the condition in the previous line is met, "Fizz" is printed.

```python
    elif i % 5 == 0:
```

This line checks if the current value of `i` is divisible by 5. If true, it means the number is a multiple of 5, and "Buzz" is printed.

```python
        print("Buzz")
```

If the condition in the previous line is met, "Buzz" is printed.

```python
    else:
```

If none of the previous conditions are met (i.e., the number is not divisible by 3 or 5), this line executes.

```python
        print(i)
```

In this case, the current value of `i` is printed. This handles the case for numbers that are neither multiples of 3 nor 5.

The entire block of code is indented, indicating that it belongs to the `for` loop, and this pattern repeats for each iteration of the loop.
