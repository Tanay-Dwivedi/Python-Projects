# Phone Number Details

To get the details of any number, we can use an amazing Python module known as `phonenumbers`. This module is created by **[David Drysdale](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-drysdale-1578771)** and you can use it to get the details of any phone number from anywhere in the world.

-----

## Installation

```
pip install phonenumbers
```
Firstly import the `phonenumbers` library through the terminal that will help in the program.

-----

## Code Break:

```python
# Import necessary modules from the phonenumbers library
import phonenumbers as ph
from phonenumbers import carrier
from phonenumbers import geocoder
from phonenumbers import timezone
```

These lines import the required modules from the `phonenumbers` library.

```python
# Define the phone number
number = "+91XXXXXXXXXX"
```

This line sets the variable `number` to the phone number you want to analyze. Replace "+91XXXXXXXXXX" with the actual phone number.

```python
# Parse the phone number using the parse function from the phonenumbers module
number = ph.parse(number)
```

The `ph.parse()` function is used to parse the phone number and obtain a PhoneNumber object, which can be used to extract various details.

```python
# Print the timezone information for the phone number
print(timezone.time_zones_for_number(number))

# Print the carrier (service provider) name for the phone number in English
print(carrier.name_for_number(number, "en"))

# Print the geographic description (country) for the phone number in English
print(geocoder.description_for_number(number, "en"))
```

These lines print information about the phone number:

- `timezone.time_zones_for_number(number)`: Prints the time zones associated with the provided phone number.
- `carrier.name_for_number(number, "en")`: Prints the carrier (service provider) name for the phone number in English.
- `geocoder.description_for_number(number, "en")`: Prints the geographic description (country) for the phone number in English.

Make sure to replace "+91XXXXXXXXXX" with the actual phone number you want to analyze.
