# Find Duplicates

The code defines a function that takes a list as input and returns a list of elements with duplicates

-----

## Code Break:

Certainly! Let's break down the code line by line with explanations:

```python
# Define a function named find_duplicates that takes a list x as input
def find_duplicates(x):
```

This line starts the definition of a function named `find_duplicates` that takes a list `x` as its parameter.

```python
    # Get the length of the list x
    length = len(x)
```

Here, it calculates the length of the input list `x` using the `len()` function and stores it in the variable `length`.

```python
    # Initialize an empty list to store duplicates
    duplicates = []
```

This line initializes an empty list named `duplicates` that will be used to store duplicate elements.

```python
    # Iterate over each element in the list using index i
    for i in range(length):
```

It starts a loop that iterates over each element in the list using the index `i`.

```python
        # Set n to the next index after i
        n = i + 1
```

Within the loop, it sets `n` to the next index after `i`.

```python
        # Iterate over the remaining elements in the list starting from index n
        for a in range(n, length):
```

Another nested loop begins, iterating over the remaining elements in the list starting from index `n`.

```python
            # Check if the elements at indices i and a are equal and the element is not already in duplicates
            if x[i] == x[a] and x[i] not in duplicates:
```

Here, it checks if the elements at indices `i` and `a` are equal, and if the element at index `i` is not already in the `duplicates` list.

```python
                # If conditions are met, add the element to the duplicates list
                duplicates.append(x[i])
```

If the conditions are met, it adds the element at index `i` to the `duplicates` list.

```python
    # Return the list of duplicates
    return duplicates
```

The function returns the list of duplicate elements after both loops are complete.

```python
# Create a list of names
names = ["Aman", "Akanksha", "Divyansha", "Devyansh", "Aman", "Diksha", "Akanksha"]
```

Here, a list of names is created.

```python
# Call the find_duplicates function with the names list and print the result
print(find_duplicates(names))
```

The `find_duplicates` function is called with the `names` list as an argument, and the result (the list of duplicate names) is printed to the console.
