# Histogram and Density Plots

Histogram and density plots are a good way to quickly visualize and analyze the distribution of the dataset.

**Histogram:**
Histogram and density plots are a good way to analyze continuous variables. Histograms are generated by bining data to count the number of frequencies in the data set.

**Density Plots:**
The appearance of density plots is dependent on bandwidth. The bandwidth parameter of density plots behaves the same as the bin width of histograms. If the bandwidth is very small, the density plot will look very sharp, and if the bandwidth is very large, the smaller features in the dataset will disappear.

## Installation

```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib plotly seaborn
```
Firstly import the `numpy pandas matplotlib plotly seaborn` libraries through the terminal that will help in the program.

-----

## Code Break:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```

Imports the necessary libraries and modules.

```python
sns.set()
```

Sets the default Seaborn theme.

```python
data = np.random.multivariate_normal([0, 0], [[5, 2], [2, 2]], size=2000)
data = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=["x", "y"])
```

Generates a 2D dataset with 2000 samples, where the samples are drawn from a multivariate normal distribution. The dataset is then stored in a Pandas DataFrame with columns "x" and "y".

```python
plt.hist(data["x"], alpha=0.5)
plt.hist(data["y"], alpha=0.5)
```

Creates histograms for the "x" and "y" columns of the dataset. `alpha=0.5` adds transparency to the bars.

```python
plt.show()
```

Displays the histograms.

**Density Plots:**

```python
sns.set()
```

Sets the default Seaborn theme again.

```python
data = np.random.multivariate_normal([0, 0], [[5, 2], [2, 2]], size=2000)
data = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=["x", "y"])
```

Generates a new 2D dataset with 2000 samples and stores it in a Pandas DataFrame with columns "x" and "y".

```python
sns.kdeplot(data["x"], shade=True)
sns.kdeplot(data["y"], shade=True)
```

Creates kernel density plots (KDE) for the "x" and "y" columns of the dataset with shading.

```python
plt.show()
```

Displays the density plots.

In summary, this script generates random 2D datasets, creates histograms, and density plots using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`. The Seaborn library is used to enhance the visual appearance of the plots.
