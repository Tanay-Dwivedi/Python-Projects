# Mad Libs Game

`MAD LIBS` is one of the funniest word games in the world.
The design of the code for the Mad Libs with Python should be in a manner that it should ask users to input a series of entries which will be considered a Mad Lib.

-----

# Code Break:

```python
color = input("Enter a Color: ")
```

This line prompts the user to input a color and assigns the input to the variable `color`.

```python
pluralNoun = input("Enter a Plural Noun: ")
```

This line prompts the user to input a plural noun and assigns the input to the variable `pluralNoun`.

```python
celebrity = input("Enter the name of a celebrity: ")
```

This line prompts the user to input the name of a celebrity and assigns the input to the variable `celebrity`.

```python
print("Roses are ", color)
```

This line prints the first line of the poem, incorporating the user's input for the color.

```python
print(pluralNoun, " is blue")
```

This line prints the second line of the poem, incorporating the user's input for the plural noun.

```python
print("I like ", celebrity)
```

This line prints the third line of the poem, incorporating the user's input for the celebrity.

The script then outputs a short poem-like message based on the user's inputs.
