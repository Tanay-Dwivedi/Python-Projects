# Bias and Variance

When training a machine learning model, it is very important to understand the bias and variance of predictions of your model. It helps in analyzing prediction errors which help us in training more accurate machine learning models.

Bias is the difference between predicted values and expected results. A machine learning model with a low bias is a perfect model and a model with a high bias is expected with a high error rate on the training and test sets.

Variance is the variability of your modelâ€™s predictions over different sets of data. A machine learning model with high variance indicates that the model may work well on the data it was trained on, but it will not generalize well on the dataset it has never seen before.

## Installation

```
pip install mlxtend numpy pandas scikit-learn
```
Firstly import the `mlxtend numpy pandas scikit-learn` library through the terminal that will help in the program.

-----

## Code Break:

```python
from mlxtend.evaluate import bias_variance_decomp
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.utils import shuffle
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
```

Here, the `mlxtend.evaluate` module is imported to access the `bias_variance_decomp` function, and other essential libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn are imported.

The code begins by importing necessary libraries and modules for performing bias-variance decomposition, data manipulation, and machine learning.

```python
data = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amankharwal/Website-data/master/student-mat.csv")
```

The code loads a dataset from a URL using the Pandas library and stores it in the variable `data`.

```python
data = data[["G1", "G2", "G3", "studytime", "failures", "absences"]]
```

It then selects specific columns ("G1", "G2", "G3", "studytime", "failures", "absences") from the loaded dataset.

```python
predict = "G3"
```

The target variable for prediction is specified as "G3".

```python
x = np.array(data.drop(columns=[predict]))
y = np.array(data[predict])
```

The features (`x`) and the target variable (`y`) are separated from the dataset.

```python
xtrain, xtest, ytrain, ytest = train_test_split(x, y, test_size=0.2)
```

The dataset is split into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split` function from scikit-learn.

```python
linear_regression = LinearRegression()
```

An instance of the Linear Regression model is created.

```python
linear_regression.fit(xtrain, ytrain)
```

The model is trained using the training data.

```python
y_pred = linear_regression.predict(xtest)
```

Predictions are made on the test set using the trained model.
